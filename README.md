This is Prof. Kadambari Deherkar,  I have uploaded a file named "IBM_Final_Submission_KSD.docx" which contains a drive link where all files are uploaded since there is limit on size on github upload. The drive link contains the following files:
Trained model downloaded from IBM Cloud (h5 file)
Three badges received for the courses mapped to AI/ML with Cloud

Zip file containing all the files used in Pycharm for UI integration
